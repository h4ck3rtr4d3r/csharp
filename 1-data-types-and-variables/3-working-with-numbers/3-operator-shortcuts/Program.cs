/*
  often we need to update a variable in our program. We can do so by modifying that variable using an arithmetic expression, then re-saving it to the same variable name
  
    int apple = 0;
    apple = apple + 1;
    Console.WriteLine(apple); // prints 1
  
  For instances, we can condense the same program above using the shorthand ++. The combined addition signs represent the idea of incrementing by one. We can do the same with he subtraction symbol --.
  
    // a shorter way to do the same thing.
    int apple = 0;
    apple++;
    Console.WriteLine(apple); // prints 1

  If we want the amount to increment by another value, say 3, we would do the following:
  
    int apple = 0;
    apple += 3; // is the same as apple = apple + 3;
    Console.WriteLine(apple); // prints 3

  Again, if we want to decrement, you would do -=3.
  Ultimately, programmers disagree on this, so everyone does it differently! But here we prefer clarity over conciseness, so we'll use the long form (apple = apple + 3) except for incrementing by one (apple++).
